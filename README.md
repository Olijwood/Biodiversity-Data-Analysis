For this project I ran analysis on data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks. You can see my code and findings in 'Biodiversity in National Parks Portfolio Project.ipynb' file.

In this file I explored:
 - What is the distribution of conservation status for Fauna
 - Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
 - Which animal species were spotted the most at each park?
 - Which animal species were spotted the least at each park?
 - A hypothetical scenario to calculate the minimum weeks required to collect a necassary sample size
 - Animal observations by Category in each National Park
 - Count of Animals by Category and Conservation Status
 
Graphs were created to display my findings using Seaborn and MatPlotLib, which you can also find in the directory
